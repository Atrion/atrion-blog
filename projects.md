# Projects

Here you'll find a list of things I'm currently working on, thinking about starting, or simply dreaming up.

## Active Projects
- Building this blog and keeping it alive.
- Researching local history of my community in PEI.
- Increasing my Bible study and notes

## Future Ideas
- Compile a collection of personal writings into a book.
- Create a photo archive of PEI landscapes and landmarks.

(Subject to change, and probably will!)
