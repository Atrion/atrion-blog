Let's be honest, some days the world feels a little broken.

Not in the big dramatic \"end of everything\" way, but in the small stupid things: slow websites, confusing paperwork, people who block store aisles...

Today's minor frustration was just trying to get this blog fully set up. Tiny tweaks turning into small problems. But you know what? I got there.

Sometimes you just have to rant a little, then get back to it.
