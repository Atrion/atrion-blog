Not a whole lot to report today, but I’ll put a few things down while I’ve got the time and clarity.

**Thursday night’s meeting** was encouraging, though I didn’t get up to speak this time. The prayer portion ran longer than usual, which is a good problem to have. After that, another Brother stood up and shared a message that really uplifted the assembly. So while I stayed quiet, I don't see that as a loss, the message that was needed got spoken, and I was glad to hear it.

**Friday** was the usual grocery day: expensive, dull, and necessary. Not much else to say there.

I've spent a good chunk of the week **reformatting and organizing my notes in Obsidian**, moving over transcripts, personal writings, poetry, and more. The structure is starting to make sense now.

Two writing projects hit milestones this week. I finished off a devotional series on **"The Christian Armour"** and completed **Part One** of an article titled **"The Gift of Singleness."** So far, the devotional pieces have been shared within my assembly and with a trusted friend who’s also a preacher. I’ve also passed the article along to him and hope to get some honest feedback soon.

Today was a bit more lively. The siblings came over, and we had a combined family get-together ( part late Easter, part Mother’s Day, part Mom’s birthday, part my own birthday). Just a simple afternoon with pizza, cake, and the nephews. Nothing fancy, but good to have everyone under the same roof for a while.

**Tomorrow morning is our usual Gospel meeting for the Philippines via Zoom.** My turn to speak is coming up at the end of the month (May 31st), so I’ll need to start praying and preparing for that as well.

My sister also brought up some books and magazines I picked up in a recent local auction. What I thought was just a single bound volume of 1920s newspapers has turned out to be one full book *plus* several bags of partial bindings. That’s going to take some sorting, and I’m not sure where I’m putting it all yet.

Which ties into another ongoing task: **figuring out a way to properly catalogue my Island book collection.** A lot of these books don’t have ISBNs, either due to age or obscurity, and many aren’t listed in any known databases. I might have to do this manually, which is a daunting prospect, but I want to make sure they’re preserved and documented.

Tonight there's a **devotional message on Zoom**, hosted by **Orangewood Gospel Hall in the USA**. Then it’s off to bed and preparing my heart and mind for the **Worship and Breaking of Bread meeting** tomorrow morning.

That’s it for now. Just a mix of small updates and quiet work.
