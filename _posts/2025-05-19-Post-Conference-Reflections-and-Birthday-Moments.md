So, it’s been a bit since the last post.

The Island Gospel Conference just wrapped up this past weekend. It was held at Bluefield School, and as always, it was a blessing. Solid ministry, a clear and faithful gospel message, more good food than any of us needed, sugary desserts that tested everyone’s resolve, and most of all, amazing fellowship with other believers. 

I had some deep, meaningful conversations with a few preachers whose words and lives have been a great inspiration to me. Moments like that stick with you.

There was a particularly encouraging moment when someone who hadn’t seen me since before I started my diet pointed out how much weight I’d lost. I’m not sure I always see it myself, but it meant a lot to hear it from someone who remembered what I looked like before. Here’s hoping the next six months bring the same kind of progress.

Today was the birthday of a friend, and the wife of another friend, part of the MacKenzie family, who truly treat me like one of their own. They’re always kind, warm, and welcoming, and I’ve never left their home without a smile. We shared a big meal, had cake for her, and surprisingly another cake for me, since my birthday is tomorrow. I got to spend time with the whole family, chatted with the adults, and read a few books to the kids. Honestly, it was one of those evenings that reminds you what real community looks like.

The challenge now is to carry the weight of the ministry shared at the conference into daily life. It’s easy to let the "conference high" fade once everything returns to normal. I’ve started relistening to some of the messages and taking notes. Truthfully, I really need to learn to take notes during the meetings themselves, but there’s something about hearing it again that helps it finally land.

A friend of mine has his girlfriend visiting, but her trip is nearing its end, she leaves mid-day Wednesday. I know it’s going to be tough for him once she’s gone. Sometimes the hardest part of something good is saying goodbye to it, even if it is only for a time.

And as for this blog, I can’t let it go the way of so many past attempts. I’m not aiming to post daily, but I need to commit to at least a weekly update. It helps keep the momentum going and keeps me grounded.

If everything worked like I hoped, there should be a few images from the conference just below. (Still figuring this part out.)

Until next time.
