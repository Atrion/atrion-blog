Saturday morning I had the opportunity to share the Gospel during a Zoom meeting for the Philippines. The whole session ran about 30 minutes, with my portion taking around 15. I tried something new this time: instead of just a single camera feed, I used a dual-window setup. My video was in the lower-left corner, and the main screen displayed Bible verses in both English and Tagalog. I used **FreeShow** for the Scripture display and **OBS** to tie everything together. 

I *think* it went well, but I’m never the best judge of my own speaking. I tend to second guess how it landed. Sometimes I wonder if people say the message was good just to keep from discouraging me.

Now I’m working on a ministry message for later this month, our usual **second Thursday** ministry night. I’ve also started laying the groundwork for a written devotional series based on the **churches in Revelation**. That project is still in the research phase, but it’s taking shape. In addition, I’m preparing a spoken devotional for **Orangewood Gospel Hall’s Saturday Zoom broadcast**.

> *Take all our troubles to God in prayer.*  
> But I often wonder what His response is, or if I even hear it right.  
> I still struggle with myself; with anxiety, hesitation, and self-doubt.

There are moments when I want to stand up during a meeting and pray, or share verses or ministry, but I hold back. I fight myself - mentally and emotionally - and more often than not, I end up sitting in silence.  

That said, I *did* follow through on the Zoom Gospel this past Saturday. And I’m scheduled for a short Gospel message at **The Willows** the Sunday after next. 

I’ve learned that once I commit to speaking, I follow through, even if I don’t always feel like the message is great. But trying to apply that same mindset in regular meetings doesn’t always work.  

Some days I wonder if my faith is lacking, not because I don’t believe, but because **I get in the way of myself**.

If you’ve read this far, you’ve probably gathered that my brain is a strange place to be. Hah!

Another Sunday has come and gone without me rising to speak. The meeting was fairly full, with a visiting guest in as well, so things moved quickly from one speaker to the next. That’s my *excuse*, anyway. Deep down I know it’s just that, an excuse. And it frustrates me. Then I get frustrated about being frustrated. A cycle.

We had a **free yard sale** at the hall on Saturday. I wasn’t able to attend, but I did contribute a few books and designed the flyer and online ad. Unfortunately, it also led to an issue Sunday morning, I was running late and didn’t realize the **main microphone had been unplugged** for the yard sale. I didn’t notice it wasn’t reconnected. So the **Sunday morning audio recording** ended up being captured only by the backup mic at the back of the room. That mic is old, meant mostly for enhancing hymn vocals. The result: muddy, distant audio. I managed to salvage part of the message, but not all. Disappointing, but a lesson learned.

This upcoming weekend I’ll be traveling to the **Halifax Bible Study Conference**. I’ll be going with a few people I haven’t traveled with before, so that’ll be a new experience. I’m still not sure if we leave Friday or Saturday, but I’ll have the full details soon. It may be socially exhausting, but I truly think (and pray) it will be worth it. Even just for the time in the Word and the ministry itself.

More updates to come - Lord willing.
