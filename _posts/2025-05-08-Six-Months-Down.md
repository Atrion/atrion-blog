Today marks **six months** since I started changing my diet.

It hasn’t always been easy, but it’s been worth it. I’m down another **3.9 lbs this week**, bringing the total weight lost so far to **77.6 lbs**. It still surprises me seeing the number go down like that, but I’m learning not to question good progress. Just keep at it, day by day.

On the productivity side, I’m finally getting the hang of **Obsidian**,  at least the basics. I’ve started moving my **Bible study notes** into the vault, trying to organize them in a way that makes sense long-term. Same goes for my scattered thoughts, plans, and project outlines. 

For writing, I’m still using **Google Docs** when it comes to longer articles. It’s just easier for layout and editing, especially when I’m on the go. But I’m thinking of switching from **Google Keep** to the **Android version of Obsidian** for note-taking. We’ll see how that works in practice.

Tonight is the Prayer Meeting and Ministry message at **O'Leary Gospel Hall**. I’ve had some thoughts rattling around, maybe even the bones of a message, but I haven’t managed to piece it all together. I’m not even sure if I’ll stand up and speak at all. The hesitation is frustrating, but I’m learning not to push myself too hard.

Just thought I’d check in and record it.
