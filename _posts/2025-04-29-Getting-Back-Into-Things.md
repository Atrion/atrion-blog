Today felt like one of those quiet resets, not because anything grand happened, but because a few things finally moved forward.

For one, I got back on a bike again. It's been years. My legs remembered how (mostly), but that seat has no mercy. Felt like I pedaled for five minutes and had earned an ice pack and a nap. But it's a start. The plan isn't distance or speed right now it's *consistency*.

I also took some time to clean up this site, just a bunch of small updates here and there. Little style tweaks, layout fixes, improved tagging. I want this to be something I can build on slowly, not something that gets away from me like blogs in the past.

That goes for my Obsidian vault too. It got overgrown, bloated with folders and tags and items I wasn't really using. Today was the start of a trim-back. Reorganizing and deleting. I'm trying to return it to a place where I can write and reflect, not just manage a maze.

To balance things out, I started a rewatch of *Doctor Who,* back to the Ninth Doctor and all the leather-jacket nostalgia. There's something nice about returning to stories that once felt like home.

And of course, I kept up with my Bible reading schedule. Today's portion was:

- **Leviticus 23** About the feasts of the Lord, which were always more than calendar events, they were reminders of who He is.
- **Psalm 80** A cry for restoration, written from the ache of distance and the hope of mercy.
- **Matthew 21** The entry into Jerusalem and the clearing of the temple; a shift in tone and pace as the cross drew closer.

Not a bad day, really. Nothing flashy. But a quiet kind of progress.
