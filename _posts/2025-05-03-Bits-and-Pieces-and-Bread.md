It’s one of those days where everything I own seems to be in a different pile. Notes tucked into old folders, ideas scribbled on scraps I barely remember writing, photos scanned but never sorted—there’s just a little bit of everything and a whole lot of nowhere to put it.

I’ve been chipping away at deciding what’s worth keeping, what needs to be worked on, and what’s finally ready for the trash. You’d think after all this time I’d be better at staying organized, but then again, maybe that’s part of the charm. Or at least, that’s what I tell myself.

Somehow in the middle of all this, I’ve found myself juggling two writing projects and a couple of research tangents that feel like they’ve spiraled into full dissertations. If only this scattered brain could pay the bills, right? Hah.

The Island Gospel Conference is coming up in a couple weeks—weekend of the 17th—so that's on the radar too. I tried going to a ministry meeting with a friend last night. Turns out it wasn’t on. We only figured that out after we got there. Made the best of it though—met up with someone else instead, grabbed some food, and had some genuinely good conversations. Sometimes plans falling through lead to better ones.

I’ve also been thinking about journaling lately. It’s something I’ve never been great at. I’ll go through spurts and stops, but I’m always glad when I have a record to look back on later. Not because I think anything I’ve done is all that remarkable, but just because it’s good to remember. These posts are kind of like a public journal. I’ve kept private ones, too. Some are still around. Some probably got tossed in one of those cleaning frenzies. That’s okay.

Anyway, time to get back to sorting and writing. Maybe I’ll actually finish something tonight—but first, Bible reading and getting myself ready for tomorrow’s worship and breaking of bread. That’s the most important part of the weekend. Everything else can wait a bit.

Until next time.
