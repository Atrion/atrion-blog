Just a short note for now, nothing major to update, but still a few small things in progress behind the scenes.

I’ve been working on formatting some **new design options** for this site. Mostly layout tweaks and trying out different ways to display things better, especially the poetry section. Speaking of which, I plan to **upload a few more poems** this week, some older, some recent. I’m trying to get better at sharing them, rather than letting them sit forgotten in folders.

Also starting to wonder: **has anyone actually been reading any of this?** Not that I mind if not, this space still helps me get my thoughts in order. But part of me wonders if a **commenting feature** might be something to look into. Maybe there’s a simple way to implement one without making things messy or difficult to maintain. We’ll see.

Anyway, just keeping things moving quietly. Updates will be small and steady. As always, thanks if you’re reading, even silently.
