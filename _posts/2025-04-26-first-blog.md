So here we are.

Honestly, I don't really know what this blog will become. I've started blogs before, more times than I can probably count, and somewhere along the way I either got bored, forgot about them, or just moved on. Can't exactly say that won't happen again, but I'm trying to do better this time around.

I don't have a clear direction yet. Maybe I'll talk about projects I'm working on, maybe share some poems or writings, maybe just rant a little when the day calls for it.

A little about me for anyone who stumbles across this:
I'm from Prince Edward Island, Canada, born and raised here. I have a strong Christian faith. My life changed completely back in November of 2022 when my Spouse of 16 years passed away, and then it changed again in March of 2023 when I trusted Christ for salvation. Since then, everything's been different, not perfect, not always easy, but different in a way that matters.

Outside of that, I have way too many half-finished projects, a love for technology, an interest in writing, and probably too much to say when I actually sit down and start typing.

So here it is: the first post. 

Let's see where it goes.
