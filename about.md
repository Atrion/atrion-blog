Welcome! You might know me as Marc MacArthur, or maybe even Atrion Darnay, a lifelong Islander from beautiful Prince Edward Island, Canada.

Interests in writing, technology, and preserving the heritage and culture of the communities around me. Personal projects, researching local history, or sharing insights through writing, I strive to balance the digital world with an appreciation for where I come from.

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore!
