I wake with her name beneath my breath  
The morning comes, but something stays dark  
I sit with silence and yesterday’s weight  
Grief lingers like a second shadow  
Her touch is gone, but not her pull  
I speak aloud just to keep her close  
I count days like drifting leaves  
Sometimes I still reach beside me  
I never knew how deep the breaking goes  
The world kept moving but I couldn’t  
I stayed still for longer than I expected  
There were days I did nothing but feel  
Eventually I stood for a little while  
Some evenings passed without tears  
The weight changed but never disappeared  
I speak her name less but think it more  
Some laughter returns without warning  
I breathe in places we never shared  
Her photo feels like having her near  
I miss her in ways that don’t have words  
What we shared still holds me together  
The pain is quiet sometimes but never gone  
I live each day with her still in it

You once breathed deeper when I stirred  
I watched the light reach across your face  
I remember the hush between our words  
I left behind more love than words  
You still feel what we once made together  
You always spoke with your heart wide open  
I once held time too tightly in my hands  
I hope you know what lingers still  
I never told you how strong you were  
You were the one who made stillness matter  
I left gently with too much unfinished  
You held on even when it hurt to stay  
You never rushed the ache away  
Some moments softened around you  
The sorrow changed its shape with time  
You never said goodbye and I never asked you to  
I would have smiled at the sound of your laugh  
You walk through days I never reached  
I know the way you look when remembering  
You carry me in silence and in memory  
Love like ours does not vanish in time  
You are learning to live while still loving  
You carry me where I always was
