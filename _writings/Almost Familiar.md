Sometimes I see it in a glance,  
A phrase spoken without thought,  
The way a question lingers,  
Or silence holds its breath.  

It isn’t something I can name,  
Just a thread pulled from a story  
We never found the end of it,  
Still running beneath the words.  

I don’t reach for what was lost,  
But now and then I pause,  
When a smile meets the moment  
Like something I used to know.
