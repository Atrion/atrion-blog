Living each day, striving to walk His way,<br>
Seeking His presence as we sit and pray,<br>
Following closely, obeying His call,<br>
Soon He will come for all.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
Patiently waiting for that glorious day,<br>
Praising Him always, in His perfect way,<br>
Living each moment, guided by His light,<br>
In glory oh so bright.<br>
</div>

Walking in faith, trusting His perfect way,<br>
Serving in love, we worship and we pray,<br>
Living in hope, we hold His promise near,<br>
Our Saviour will appear.<br>

Bearing our cross, we follow in His steps,<br>
Shining His love, we share the joy He kept,<br>
Faithful and true, through trials we stand,<br>
For that heavenly land.<br>

Jesus, our King, we honor and adore,<br>
He is our life, our hope forevermore,<br>
With every breath, we offer Him our praise,<br>
This till the end of days.
