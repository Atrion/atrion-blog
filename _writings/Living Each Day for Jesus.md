Living each day, striving to walk His way,
Seeking His presence as we sit and pray,
Following closely, obeying His call,
Soon He will come for all.

    Patiently waiting for that glorious day,
    Praising Him always, in His perfect way,
    Living each moment, guided by His light,
    In glory oh so bright.

Walking in faith, trusting His perfect way,
Serving in love, we worship and we pray,
Living in hope, we hold His promise near,
Our Saviour will appear.

Bearing our cross, we follow in His steps,
Shining His love, we share the joy He kept,
Faithful and true, through trials we stand,
For that heavenly land.

Jesus, our King, we honor and adore,
He is our life, our hope forevermore,
With every breath, we offer Him our praise,
This till the end of days.
