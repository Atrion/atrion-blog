This is a catalouged listing of all the Island Books that I own.
This collection has some books obtained by my Grandmother (Helen MacArthur) before her passing, and the majority of books that I have acquired since moving back to Western PEI.
This is a listing only of the Physical books I have, I plan to eventually add any digital books I also Own.
