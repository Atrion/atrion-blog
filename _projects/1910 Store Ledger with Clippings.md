This is a Set of digital photos of a damaged store ledger dating back to around 1910. 
The book had been turned into a scrapbook of newspaper clippings and shows signs of significant wear. 

It is beleived that this ledger my have belonged to an old store that was in Glenwood PEI, Located at the corner of Route 14 and the MacDonald Road, a store owned by a Flora Baldwin.

This item was graciously loaned to me by West Point resident Audrey MacDonald.
